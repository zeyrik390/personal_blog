Hey there! My name’s not that important, but you can call me Zeyrik. I'm a passionate maker who loves tinkering, building, and coding—basically anything that involves creating something cool from scratch.

Whether it’s 3D printing, electronics, PCB design, Python automation, or writing firmware for microcontrollers, I love diving into new projects and learning along the way. I spend a lot of my free time geeking out over technology, especially anything that lets me combine hardware and software in fun ways.

I've always wanted to start a blog to document my projects, share ideas, and maybe even help someone else along their own maker journey. But between work and life, it never quite happened... until now.

Thanks to tools like AI that help me correct and improve my writing, it's finally easier (and faster) for me to share my thoughts and creations. That little boost of support gave me the push I needed to finally start this blog.

A little more about me: I’m a huge fan of video games. So, naturally, a lot of my projects are inspired by gaming. From custom mods to themed builds, I love blending technology with my favorite games to create something unique.

In my next post (my first real project entry) I’ll be showing off a fun mod I made for the Piranha Plant Webcam for the Nintendo Switch 2. I love the product, but the quality of the video... aïe. I can’t wait to share the details, the process, and some behind-the-scenes photos.

Thanks for stopping by! I’m excited to finally kick off this blog and share what I’ve been building.
See you online!
